# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
I am proud that I tried to call methods within methods even though it didn't work yet!
1. What do you need to improve?
I need to learn to use pry. I also need to simplify this project by using strategies I understand instead of introducing too many new things at once.
1. What questions do you still have?
How to branch in github. How to read or use my github files that are part red / part green.

# Rubric

## Functionality - 1

Notes: I completed Iteration 1 and need to try other approaches for turning it into a class. My first approach of calling methods from inside other methods was too complex for my current knowledge. 

- [1] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics - 2

Notes:

The student(s): I need to expand my experience using methods that I have defined in a class.

- [3] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [2] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [2] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [2] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [1] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design - 2

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [2] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [2] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [1] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 1

Notes:

The student(s): I need to do more of the Ruby exercises to be familiar with tests.

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control - 2

Notes: I need to make more commits so I remember what I tried in the past.

The student(s):

- [3] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [1] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [1] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
